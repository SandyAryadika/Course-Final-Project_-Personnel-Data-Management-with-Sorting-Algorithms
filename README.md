# Course-Final-Project_-Personnel-Data-Management-with-Sorting-Algorithms

This final project integrates advanced programming concepts with the implementation of the bubble sort and exponential sort algorithms, as well as the use of data structures such as structs and arrays, in the context of analyzing the largest number of civil servants based on job types and functional positions. The analysis results are then stored in a text file. This program can be considered a simple application for managing personnel data.
